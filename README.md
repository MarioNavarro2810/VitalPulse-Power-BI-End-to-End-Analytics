### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Source: ERP export (`ExtraccionERP.xlsx`) with 33 columns in flat format.    
- Key metrics: Sales (MoM/YoY), margin evolution, delayed & cancelled orders, customer segmentation, top-selling products.  
- Objective: Deliver dashboards fully aligned with the client’s decision-making needs.  

### 2. Data Extraction & Transformation
- Imported Excel extract into Power BI.  
- Cleaned and validated fields using Power Query.  
- Corrected data types, removed duplicates/nulls, and fixed anomalies.

### 3. Data Modelling
- Built a **star schema**:  
  - Fact tables: `f_nvl_ventas` (sales line level), `f_nvl_pedido` (order level).  
  - Dimension tables: Customers, Orders, Products, Dates.  
- Ensured correct granularity: order vs. sales line.  
- One-to-many relationships from dimensions to facts.

### 4. DAX Calculations
Created measures to analyze:  
- **Sales KPIs**: monthly totals, MoM & YoY growth, trends.  
- **Margins**: % margin evolution, growth comparisons.  
- **Orders & Logistics**: cancelled, delayed, avg. units/order.  
- **Customers**: number by region, mapping fixes (e.g., Puerto Rico).   

### 4. DAX Calculations
Created measures to analyze:  
- **Sales KPIs**: monthly totals, MoM & YoY growth, trends.  
- **Margins**: % margin evolution, growth comparisons.  
- **Orders & Logistics**: cancelled, delayed, avg. units/order.  
- **Customers**: number by region, mapping fixes (e.g., Puerto Rico).


### 5. Dashboard Design
Three dashboards were developed:  

1. **Sales**: revenue, units, margins, trends.  
2. **Logistics**: delayed & cancelled orders, delivery performance.  
3. **Products & Customers**: top-selling items, customer distribution, segmentation.
