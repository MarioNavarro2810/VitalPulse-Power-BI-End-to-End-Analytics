### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Source: ERP export (`ExtraccionERP.xlsb`) with 33 columns in flat format.    
- Key metrics: Sales (MoM/YoY), margin evolution, delayed & cancelled orders, customer segmentation, top-selling products.  
- Objective: Deliver dashboards fully aligned with the clientâ€™s decision-making needs.  

### 2. Data Extraction & Transformation
- Imported Excel extract into Power BI.  
- Cleaned and validated fields using Power Query.  
- Corrected data types, removed duplicates/nulls, and fixed anomalies.

### 3. Data Modelling
- Built a **star schema**:
  - Fact tables: `f_nvl_ventas` (sales line level), `f_nvl_pedido` (order level).  
  - Dimension tables: Customers, Orders, Products, Dates.  
- Ensured correct granularity: order vs. sales line.  
- One-to-many relationships from dimensions to facts.
- The star schema design and table relationships are also documented in a dedicated Excel file:  
  [`modelling/Data Modelling.xlsx`](modelling/Data%20Modelling.xlsx)  
  This file includes the mapping of fact and dimension tables, granularity levels, and schema structure used in Power BI.

### 4. DAX Calculations
Created measures to analyze:  
- **Sales KPIs**: monthly totals, MoM & YoY growth, trends.  
- **Margins**: % margin evolution, growth comparisons.  
- **Orders & Logistics**: cancelled, delayed, avg. units/order.  
- **Customers**: number by region, mapping fixes (e.g., Puerto Rico).

### 5. Dashboard Design
Three dashboards were developed:  

1. **Sales**: revenue, units, margins, trends.  
2. **Logistics**: delayed & cancelled orders, delivery performance.  
3. **Products & Customers**: top-selling items, customer distribution, segmentation.

### 7. How to Use This Project
1. **Clone the repository**:<br>  
   ```bash<br>
   git clone https://github.com/MarioNavarro2810/VitalPulse-BI-Project.git

2. **Open VitalPulse.pbix in Power BI Desktop**.<br>
   File: reports/Proyecto final.pbix<br>
   Explore the dashboards, visuals, and DAX measures already set up.

3. **Explore the ERP dataset**<br>

   File: data/ExtraccionERP.xlsb<br>
   This is the raw ERP extract in Excel Binary Workbook format (.xlsb), which helps reduce file size compared to .xlsx.<br>
   You can open it directly in Excel or import it into Power BI.<br>
   If you prefer .xlsx, simply open the file in Excel and save it as Excel Workbook (.xlsx)*.<br>

4. **Review the data model design**<br>

File: modelling/Data Modelling.xlsx<br>
Contains the star schema, fact and dimension tables, and relationship design used in the Power BI report.<br>
